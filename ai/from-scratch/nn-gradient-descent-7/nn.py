# A neural network could be said to be:
# Vector z = f(Vector x, Vector w, Vector T)
# x = inputs
# w = weights
# t = threshold
# A NN is a function approximator

# Sample data (desired vector)
# function of the inputs
# Vector d = g(x)

# Performance function
# P = - || Vector d  - Vector z || ** 2
# measure the magnitude of the difference
