# A dot product is a loose measurement of similarity
# between two vectors

# In weights and inputs
# If the weight vector is similar to the input vector of
# image of number 2, then it will output a high score
# If they are not similar, then it will output a low score.

# Gradient descent is a general learning algorithm
